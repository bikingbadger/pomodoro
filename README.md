> Timer for getting tasks done by breaking them into smaller chunks. The timer uses the pomodoro method by setting 4 sessions of 25 minutes of work that have 5 minute rests. After the fourth working session there is a longer 15 minute rest session.

After setting your Todoist API key it will pull in the days tasks and you can order the tasks into a pompom which is 25 minutes. This allows you to estimate how long something will take and then plan your day without getting overwhelmed.

## ⛏️ Usage

1. Register on the app and then input your API Key from Todoist.
2. This will import the daily tasks and update throughout the day should you make changes in the Todoist App
3. You can sort the list by order and start the clock
4. Work through your tasks one by one.
5. The added benefit is that you will be able to plan the day by estimating whether you'll get to everything in the list.
